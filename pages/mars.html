                    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is covered
                        in iron(III) oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet". Mars is among the brightest
                        objects in Earth's sky, and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a common subject for
                        telescope viewing. It is classified as a terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the
                        Solar System's planets with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi). In terms of orbital motion, a
                        Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours, and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth
                        years (687 Earth days). Mars has two natural satellites that are small and irregular in shape:
                        Phobos and Deimos. <br><br>
                        Mars was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. During the Noachian period (4.5 to 3.5
                        billion years ago), Mars's surface was marked by meteor impacts, valley formation, erosion, and
                        the possible presence of water oceans. The Hesperian period (3.5 to 3.3â€“2.9 billion years ago)
                        was dominated by widespread volcanic activity and flooding that carved immense outflow channels.
                        The Amazonian period, which continues to the present, has been marked by the wind as a dominant
                        influence on geological processes. Due to Mars's geological history, the possibility of past or
                        present life on Mars remains of great scientific interest. <br><br>
                        Since the late 20th century, Mars has been explored by uncrewed spacecraft and rovers, with the
                        first flyby by the Mariner 4 probe in 1965, the first orbit by the Mars 2 probe in 1971, and the
                        first landing by the Viking 1 probe in 1976. As of 2023, there are at least 11 active probes
                        orbiting Mars or on the Martian surface. Mars is an attractive target for future human
                        exploration missions, though in the 2020s no such mission is planned.

            <h3>MARS ROVERS</h3>
            <p>A Mars rover is a remote-controlled motor vehicle designed to travel on the surface of Mars. Rovers have
                several advantages over stationary landers: they examine more territory, they can be directed to
                interesting features, they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months, and they
                can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control. They serve a different
                purpose than orbital spacecraft like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. A more recent development is the Mars
                helicopter.</p>
            <p>As of May 2021, there have been six successful robotically operated Mars rovers; the first five, managed
                by the American NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, were (by date of Mars landing): Sojourner (1997), Spirit
                (2004â€“2010), Opportunity (2004â€“2018), Curiosity (2012â€“present), and Perseverance (2021â€“present). The
                sixth, managed by the China National Space Administration, is Zhurong (2021â€“2022).</p>
